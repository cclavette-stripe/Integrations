This is a repository of all the scripts included in the spin-up checklist (see: https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/TSS-Onboarding-Checklist-Coreys-Copy--Bh3oC4OnOXBZWJbCNzWgdOYZAg-VseUS440R0crR8l3SLWBw) as well as some additional scripts I wrote as-needed to make my core work easier.

        - scratch
        - scratch-client

    - Python
        - create-and-advance-test-clock.py 
        - create-invoice-custom-fields.py

Scratch files are included as templates for creating new scripts and integrations.
