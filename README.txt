This is a repository of all the scripts included in the spin-up checklist as well as some additional scripts I wrote as-needed to make my core work easier.

        - integration-skeleton
        - orders
        - scratch
        - scratch-client
        - search-metadata
        - terminal-in-person
        - terminal-simulated
    - Python
        - create-and-advance-test-clock.py 
        - create-invoice-custom-fields.py 
        - create-subscription-trial-test-clock.py 
        - create-test-clock.py 
        - delete-products.py 
        - email-invoice.py 
        - list-products.py 
        - scratch.py

Scratch files are included as templates for creating new scripts and integrations.
